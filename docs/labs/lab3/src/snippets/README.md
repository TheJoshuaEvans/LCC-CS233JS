# HTML Snippets
What the heck is going on in this directory? What is `*.html.js`?

These are just JavaScript modules that return a formatted HTML string. It's just my own convention that helps me remember that these functions are specific in their purpose

The actual HTML is made with regular template strings, prepended with `/*html*/` which, thanks to the [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) VSCode extension, gives me the correct syntax highlighting :D
